### Warning: Incomplete

This is a project i worked on in my free time to learn some PyGTK with Arch Linux. This project is *not* finished however it does work.

### oAuth

You will need a `Config.ini` file in the `reddit` directory as described in [this project](https://github.com/SmBe19/praw-OAuth2Util/tree/master/OAuth2Util) in order for login to work. Login *is required* at the moment as it tries logging in immediately when the program starts.
